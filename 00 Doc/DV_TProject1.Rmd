#First of all, We are going to source these packages below
```{r}
require("jsonlite")
require("RCurl")
require("dplyr")
require("ggplot2")
require("knitr")
require("dplyr")
require("extrafont")
```
  
  
#Next, we modified the R_ETL.R file and use it to create two tables on SQL server. The modified versions are as follows:
##The tabels we get are as follows:  
###Alaska OilWell's R_ETL.R file:  
![](Oil.png)  
CREATE TABLE Alaska_OilWell (  
-- Change table_name to the table name you want.  
 api_number varchar2(4000),  
 operator_name varchar2(4000),  
 well_name varchar2(4000),  
 status varchar2(4000),  
 parent varchar2(4000),  
 cik varchar2(4000),  
 serialid varchar2(4000),  
 latitude number(38,4),  
 longitude number(38,4)  
 );
   
###Baltimore Salaries's R_ETL2.R file:  
![](Baltimore.png)  
CREATE TABLE Baltimore_Salary (  
-- Change table_name to the table name you want.  
 name varchar2(4000),  
 jobtitle varchar2(4000),  
 agencyid varchar2(4000),  
 agency varchar2(4000),  
 hiredate varchar2(4000),  
 serialid varchar2(4000),  
 annualsalary number(38,4),  
 grosspay number(38,4)  
 );  
 
#After loading these datasets into Oracle, now we are going to use Tableau to make 4 different plots. They are scatterplot, crosstab, and bar chart. Then we will do the same thing using R-Studio
  
##First Plot: This is a scatterplot, and we are using Alaska Oil Well dataset to plot it.
![](Alaska_OilWell_Scatterplot.png) 
  
##Analysis: 
This is actually not only a Scatterplot between "Longitude" and "Latitude"; this is more of a plot/ map demonstrating the geographic locations/ distributions of different oil companies' oil wells. From this scatterplot, we can see that ARCO ALASKA INC and EXXON CORP are managing the majority of oil wells operating on sea. The Northest oil well belongs to SHELL WESTERN INC with Longitude and Latitude of approximately (-165.81, 71.85). The Southernest oil well is operated by CITY OF AKUTAN with Longitude and Latitude of (-165.85, 54.15). The most important information we can get from this scatterplot is that we can clearly tell, from the distributions of oil wells that the concentration of oil and gas is mainly at the north and south borders of Alaska State.
  
  
##Second Plot: This is also a scatterplot but we are using Baltimore Salaries data set.

##Analysis: 
  
  
##Third Plot: This is a crosstab, and we are using Baltimore Salaries dataset to plot it.

##Analysis:  
  
  
##Fourth Plot: This is a bar chart, and we are using Alaska Oil Well dataset to plot it.
